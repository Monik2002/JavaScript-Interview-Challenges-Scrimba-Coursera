/* Panic function 
Write a PANIC! function. The function should take in a sentence and return the same
sentence in all caps with an exclamation point (!) at the end. Use JavaScript's
built in string methods. 

If the string is a phrase or sentence, add a ðŸ˜± emoji in between each word. 

Example input: "Hello"
Example output: "HELLO!"

Example input: "I'm almost out of coffee"
Example output: "I'M ðŸ˜± ALMOST ðŸ˜± OUT ðŸ˜± OF ðŸ˜± COFFEE!"

let str = "hello world";
function panic(str) {
    return str.split(" ").join(" ðŸ˜± ").toUpperCase() + "!"
}
console.log(panic(str));
